# PyPoSim [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/crazzle/PyPoSim.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/crazzle/PyPoSim)
A small power plant simulator that can ramp to a certain power level. Great for noisy time-series data generation!

**TO-DO**

[X] Provide Kafka support

[X] Ensure connection to Kafka Broker if Kafka is down on start-up

[X] Log datapoints into a file

[X] Provide REST API

[X] Add plants using UI

[X] Delete plants using UI

[X] Dispatch plants using UI

[X] Distinguish between capacity and setpoint

[X] Limit dispatch to be between zero and capacity


# Getting started
1. Clone the repo
2. Navigate into the PyPoSim folder
3. Install the required dependencies with pip install -r requirements.txt
4. run it with python PyPoSim.py (standard port is 5000)

You can run it alternatively using Docker.

# Current set of parameters
1. Capacity: The capacity of the plant
2. Fluctuation: Corridor the output fluctuates within based on the capacity
3. Ramp: Velocity to change from one power level to another

# Play with the simulator
The simulator provides a REST API to create, poll, steere and delete simulated plants.
For stream processing Kafka can be configured accordingly to push datapoints into a topic.

## Add
Plants are added via the **/add** endpoint using the HTTP POST method.
In order to function properly, the body must contain JSON in the following format:

{ "name": "Sample Plant", 	
  "internal_setpoint": 150, 	
  "fluctuation": 10, 	
  "ramp": 15 }

- "name" is the name of your plant.
- "capacity" is the power-level that this plant is able to generate at max. The output fluctuates around this value.
- "fluctuation" is the fluctuation running around the power in percentage
- "ramp" is the factor the plants ramps up and down per second in KW

A newly created plant always delivers the maximum power in the beginning.

The response of this endpoint contains a UID that is used to access the new created simulation.

## Get current power
You can get the current power using **/{UID}**.

## Get master data
You can get the master data using **/masterdata/{UID}**.

## Dispatch
You can dispatch your plant (tell it to ramp to a certain powerlevel) by using 
the **/dispatch/{UID}/{POINT}** endpoint. Point is the new powerlevel your plant should ramp to.
The plant ramps according to the ramp that was specified during creation.

## Delete
To delete a simulator just use **/delete/{UID}**
